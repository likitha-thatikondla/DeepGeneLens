# DeepGene Lens

## Overview
DeepGene Lens is a learning-oriented project that explores the application of deep learning techniques to genetic or genomic sequence data.  
The focus is on understanding how neural networks can be used to identify patterns and extract insights from biological sequences.

This project is intended for **academic learning and experimentation**.

## Contents
The repository includes:
- Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and model development
- Sequence data used for experimentation
- Model training and evaluation workflows

---

## Objective
To gain hands-on exposure to:
- Biological sequence representation
- Applying deep learning models to genomic data
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation
- Bridging machine learning concepts with bioinformatics

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Notes
- This project is exploratory and not intended for clinical or production use.
- The implementation prioritizes conceptual understanding over optimization.
